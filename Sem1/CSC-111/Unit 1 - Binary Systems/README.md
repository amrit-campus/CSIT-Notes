## 1.1 Digital Systems
### 1.1.1 Digital and Analog Systems

Let's just see the differences between **Analog** & **Digital** Systems to get a more clear view.

| S.N  | Analog Systems                                               | Digital Systems                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | The system based on analog (continuous) data such as temperature, pressure, etc is known as **Analog System**. | The system based on discrete data (i.e. either 0 or 1) is known as **Digital System**. |
| 2    | **Analog System** operates on **Sine** waves. ![Sine Wave](./sine-wave.PNG?raw=true) | **Digital System** operates on **square** waves. ![Square Wave](./square-wave.PNG?raw=true) |
| 3    | **Analog System** operates on low bandwidth.                 | **Digital System** does require high bandwidth.              |
| 4    | **Analog Systems** can never offer flexible execution.       | **Digital System** offers flexibility in execution.          |
| 5    | **Analog System** gives significant observational errors.    | **Digital Systems** provides zero observational errors.      |
| 6    | **Analog System** records waveforms as it is.                | **Digital System** collects and convert waveforms to a limited set of numbers in order to record them. |
| 7    | **Analog System** stores data in the form of wave signals.   | **Digital System** stores data in the form of binary bits (i.e 0 & 1). |
| 8    | The signals of **analog system** may be deteriorated due to noise. | The signals of **Digital Systems** are immune to deterioration. |
| 9    | **Analog Systems** are a way much cheaper.                   | **Digital Systems** can be a bit costly.                     |
| 10   | For Example :- Speedometer, Thermometer, etc.                | For Example :- Mobile Phones, Computer, etc.                 |

### 1.1.2 Block diagram of Digital Computer

There are basically two types of Computer Architecture, **Von-Neumann Architecture** and the **Harvard Architecture**.

However, **Von-Neumann Architecture** is generally coined as the (Architecture) Block diagram of Digital Computer.

### 1.1.3 Advantages / Disavantages of Digital System

###### Merits

‣ has made unachieveable successes possible.

‣ more reliable

‣ easy to manipulate

‣ flexible

‣ compatible

‣ easy storage of data

###### Demerits

‣ more energy than analog systems

‣ thus, more heat

‣ more fragile i.e if single piece of data is misinterpreted, that may cause a large block of data to be change or altered.

‣ it involves binary code

‣ thus, has **quantization** errors.
