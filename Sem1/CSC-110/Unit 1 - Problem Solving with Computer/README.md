## 1.1 Problem Analysis

**Problem Analysis** in Computer Programming is the process where we break down problems into its components, so that the problems can easily be understood. The way to do this is to write an ALGORITHM of the problem.

 **Problem Analysis**

→ Process of becoming familiar with the problem.

→ We need to analyze and understand it well before solving.

→ The users requirement cannot be fulfilled without clear understanding of his/her 
  problem in depth. 

→ Inadequate identification of problem may cause program less useful & insufficient.

→ Example: Banking Solution, Hospital Medical Study

## 1.2 Algorithm & Flowchart

An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problem or to perform a calculation.

**Three features of an Algorithm**

**1. Sequence**

**2. Decision**

**3. Repetition**
